# DDNS
My friend hosts his web server on his local computer and his domain is http://alpergokcan.net \
He has a DDNS client on his server that detects IP Address changes of the server and reports his new IP address to his nameserver. \
What this repository does is to detect his IP address changes remotely and route https://alper.cerwin.dev to his local server. \
Therefore as long as the DDNS Client on his local server functions correctly, this also works.
